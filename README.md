Architecture of project creating REST APIs in node


Clone or fork.
go in the root directory of project.
npm install/ yarn to add dependencies
npm start/ nodemon to start server.

I have not made the controllers folder because i think all db queries can be setup in models folder only beneath the schema,
or you can write its code in controllers folder for bigger projects.
